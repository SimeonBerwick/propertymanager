## 2026-03-21
- Refactored `lib/data.ts`: all five data functions now attempt real Prisma queries first, fall back to seed arrays on any DB error (connection refused, schema not migrated, etc). App is not broken when DATABASE_URL is unset.
- Removed direct `seed-data` import from `app/properties/page.tsx`; units now come through `getAllUnits()` in the data layer.
- Added `prisma/seed.ts`: idempotent seed script that writes seed-data into Postgres via upserts. Run with `npm run prisma:seed` or `npx prisma db seed`.
- Added `tsx` devDependency and `"prisma": { "seed": "..." }` config to package.json.
- Prisma client generated successfully (v6.9.0). TypeScript check: zero errors.

## Current state
The data layer is Prisma-ready. All routes read from Prisma when the DB is available and transparently degrade to seed data otherwise. The seed script can bootstrap a fresh database from the existing fixture data. Prisma client is generated and type-checked.

## Next milestone
Finish M1: add auth shell (NextAuth or Clerk), run the first migration against a real Postgres instance, then wire the landlord user to owned properties.
